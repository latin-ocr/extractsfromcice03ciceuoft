1. ROME’S RULE OF HER PROVINCES. 281

196. Qid enirn ei praecipiam quem, &c., 'for why should 1 lay
down rules for one whom ’θ’ &c. ³ Praecipiam' is a deliberative conjunctive.

205. Qae quum—necesse est, ‘these things are creditable indeed
in our private and every-day life here, but in so high a command, where
morals are so depraved, in a province so full of temptations, they cannot but
seem more than human.'

208. Haec institutio, ‘these rules.'
211. Susceptas habemus. This circumlocution is not to be regarded

as a mere substitute for the perfect : it always implies more emphatically the
present existence of the state expressed by the verb. ἔχω is used in the sarne
way in Greek. In Latin it is most commonly used with verbs signifying
‘to know’ or ‘to resolve! It is the first trace in Latin of what grew in
later times to be the regular usage, from which French and the other Romance
languages have derived their method oftforming perfect tenses, which we also
use in English.

Paeonii nescio cuius, ‘ a fellow called Paconius! ‘Nescio quis ' is one of
the phrases in Latin which is declined as if it were a single word, like
ἐστὶν ὅε and other phrases in Greek. So we often speak in English oi

conduct, which had reached his brother's ears at Rome.

219. Parvi refert, ‘it is of little avail.’

223. Iurisdictione. See Dict. of Ant. sub voce.

224. In qua—expedita est, ‘and in regard ofthis it is easy enough to
· have a mere (ipsa) theoretical knowledge of the principles of provincial
administration! ‘ Ratio' is ‘ theory ' as opposed to practice.

226. Non solum—suspicioni, ‘not merely partiality, but the very
suspicion of it.'

229. C. Octavius. This was the man who was best known for his pro-
consulship of Macedonia; he was the father of the C. Octavius who was
adopted by Julius Caesar, and who afterwards became the emperor commonly
known by his title of Augustus.

230. Apud quem, ‘in whose court.¹

Primus lictor, ‘the chief lictor?

232. Videretur—tueretur. An instance of the common Latin idiom
whereby ‘completed actions (actions supposed to be completed ?) in past time
are transferred to the present, by the use of the imperfect instead of the
pluperfect.' Zumpt, Sect. 525. The English idiom requires thern to be
translated by pluperfects. It is plain from the context that Octavius' year of
office was over.

233. Sullani homines. He means those supporters of Sulla who had
taken advantage of the Proscription to get the property of proscribed persons
by betraying or killing them.

240. Tot a u x ilia, ‘so many kinds of protection to appeal t0.' ‘ Auxilium·
