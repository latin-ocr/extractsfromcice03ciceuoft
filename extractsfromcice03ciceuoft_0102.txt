’7. How Verres robbecl Prince Antiochus of Syria.

11. 7. ¹. Non iam, literally‚ ‘ no longer! Itis as if he had said,·1have
now no longer to tell of theft: &c.

5. Hospitium, ‘the tie of hospitality.' The two Syrian princes were
¹ hospites populi Romani? ¹ Hospitium spoliatum '' is a stronger expression than
‘hospites spoliati: implying more fully the enormity of the crime: but it
sounds strange in English. It will be better to say, ‘the tie of hospitality
violated by plunder and treachery.'

6. Nationes, ‘ tribes‚’ generally applied to less organised communities than
⁸ gentes.'

10. Sed regnum. This is rnade an independent sentence, but strictly
it should either be ‘qui non venerant propter Syriae regnum, sed arbitra·
bantur! or ‘qui venerant non propter Syriae regnum, sed quod arbitra·
bantur! As the sentence stands, ‘venerant’ is the principal verb to the
whole, and ‘quod arbitrabantur' would be correlative to the prepositional
phrase ‘propter Syriae regnum! The intervention ot' the parenthesis has
caused the exact construction to be forgotten.

12. Temporibus reipublicae, ‘the circumstances of the state: He is
alluding to the servile war. which gave the Romans full occupatiori at that
tnne.

17. Quod in eius regnum venerat. This is a reason assigned by
Cicero, not part of what Verres thought: if so, the verb would have been in
the subjunctive mood, and ‘eius' would have been ⁰ suum.' Observe that
Cicero uses the word ‘regnum' for ‘provinciam' as an invidious term, to
suggest that Verres was more like an Oriental despot than a Roman
governor.

25. Copiose ornatum, ⁸ had a splendidly furnished establishment'

31. Trulla was ‘a table utensil employed sor taking the wine out of a
larger recipient, which contained a quantity mixed with snow. lt was a
species of ⁴‘ cyathus” of an improved character, being furnished with an inner
case perforated as a strainer, and fitting into the hollow bowl of the cup.'
Rich, Companion to Latin Dict. p. 693, where may be seen an engraving
osone found at Pompeii, which looks something like a rigid landing-net.

40. Qui istum non nosset, ‘as he did not know him! The relative
clause suggests a reason why he was so ready to let Verres have them, and
therefore the verb is in the subjunctive.

42. V elle se, ⁸ saying that he wished! ⁸ Velle ' is dependent on a ⁴ verbum
dicendi ’ implied from ‘rogatum.'

46. Candelabrum—afferrent. This long sentence is not quite regulam
¹ potuerunt' and ‘ voluerunt' are evidently meant for principal verbs (if they
were meant to be correlative to ⁶ offenderant’ they would be pluperfects); then,
after the intervention of a long final clause, ‘ut-perveniret: the speaker
sorgets that he has already introduced any principal verb, and puts ‘statu-
erunt' without any conjunctior). lf he had remembered that ⁶ potuerunt'
