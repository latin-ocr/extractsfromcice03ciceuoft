288. Vectigali aedilicio. These were contributions enforced from the
provinces towards the enormous expenses of the public shows given by the
curule aediles. They were apparently originally voluntary contributions‚
but gradually came to be compulsory.

eumities in consequence!

291. HS cc. This would naturally stand for 200 sestertii: with a line
over the cc (thus, ff) it would represent sestertium ducenties, = 20,000,0<:0
sestertii. The one sum is too small, the other too large for the case. aco
sestertia= 200,oo0 sestertii, would be such a sum as would suit the context,
and we must therefore consider HS as here used sor sestertia.

294. Qod—laudatur‚ ⁸ which, however it may be taken in Asia, in
Rome is received with very great approval.'

296. Ad templum monumentumque nostrum, ‘to build a temple a:
a memorial of our services.⁸ Cp. Pt. 2. ch. 6. 190, where see note on

344. Temporis causa, ‘on grounds of expediency.‘ Cp. l. 167 ‘tui
amantiorem quam temporis.'

Essent, constituerentur, tribuerentur. These must not be mistaken
for impossible hypothetical sentences, such as are put in the imp. subj. on their
own account: they are the ‘ oratio obliqua ’ of hypotlietical sentences with
pres. ind. sunt, constituuntur, tribuuntur.

346. Existimabam. The force of the tense here is, ⁶1 told you when l
wrote, that 1 thought‚' διε. It is connected in thought with ¹ quid sentirem
scripsi ad te antea' above. Of course it is not to be taken to imply that he
does not think so still.
