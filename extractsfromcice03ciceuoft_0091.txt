1. ROME'S RULE OF HER PROVINCES. 289

68. Illum annum. This is explained to refer to the year 80 Rc.. when
M. Aemilius Lepidus was Praetor of Sicily. He was succeeded by C. Mar-
cellus, whose integrity is often mentioned by Cicero.

69. Ut salvi esse non possent, ‘that they would not have recovered

from it!
71. Infinitum imperium. M. Antonius Creticus, the father of

ἱ Μ. Antonius the Tdumvir, had a commission with extraordinary powers

in the war with the pirates, extending over all the coasts of the Mediterranean,
much the same as was afterwards given to Pompeius. He misused it to
plunder the districts over which it gave him control, especially Sicily.

76. Hunc. Verres, the defendant in the suit, is usually called ‘iste,' as
explained below in note on l. 80. Here ‘hunc' is used for the sake of the
antithesis, this present man, as opposed to all who have gone before.

78. Beneficia senatus populique Romani, ‘the favours conferred
on thern by the Senate and people.'

80. Istius. ‘Iste,' in a speech made in a criminal case, always means
‘the defendant! The speaker is addressing the judices, and ‘ iste' means
‘the man before you,' ‘the prisoner at your bar.’ In these extracts the
translation may be varied by substituting the name Verres, instead of

¹ the defendant!

2. The Case of Sopater.

11. 2. 6. Eiusdem rei nomen detulerunt, ‘accused him on the sanie
charge.' ‘Nomen deferre ad praetorem’ is literally, ¹ to carry down a man's

’ name to the praetor, sitting in his court‚' which was the first step towards

getting him brought to trial. The praetor was said ⁸ nomen accipere ⁵ if he
allowed the case to be tried. Cp. 2. 3. 130. lInic Sopatro is dativus
incommodi. Eiusdem rei is genitive aster ‘nomen detulerunt: which is
equivalent to a verb of accusing.

12. In primis splendidus atque honestus. lt is to be remembcred
that the epithets attached to a man's name when mentioned by a speaker
are merely phrases of courtesy. They often would sound exaggerated if11.is
were not remembered. They may be compared to the phrases used in the
debates of tho-‘English Parlianient, e.g. the ‘right honourable gentleman.·
‘the most noble lord,' ¹ the right reverend prelate,’ or to such an expression
as ‘our most religious and gracious Qieen' in the I'rayer Book, which has
sometimes given offence from this not bting understood.

15. Accensus. See note on Letter to Quintus l. 131.

Idem. ⁰ also: ⁰ at once.'
16. Priore actione. ⁴ on the finirier hearing) The plaintiffor prosecutor

was technically said ‘agen-,¹ aud was called sometimes ‘act0r.' and all liis
proceedings. meccha, exnnrination of witnessrs, ἃς, were include-tl under the
term 'actia' 'l'ltis- part of tlte speech was written to be delivered on the
second hearing, tlte trial having l·ccn adjutum-2¹.
