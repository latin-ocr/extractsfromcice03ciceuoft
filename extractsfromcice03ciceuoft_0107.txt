ll. 10-12. ROME'S RULE OF ΗΕΒ PROVINCES. 305

praetoria venisset! Asterwards Cicero substitutes a different form of sen-
tence in the latter part, leaving the first part unaltered, so that they do not
exactly fit.

21. Offerebat. This relative clause is in the indicative mood, although
dependent on a subjunctive, because it is merely a circumlocution taking the
place of an adjective to ⁸ telum,' such as ⁴ forte oblatum,' and therefore is not
- affected by the mood of the other verbs.

22. Hora amplius iam moliebantur, ‘had been working for more
than an hour.' The combinationes the imperfect with the ‘ hora amplius iam’
implies the continuance of the action as well as the time it had already been
going on. The full force would be ‘had been working for more than an
honr, and were still at work.¹ It is the same idiom in an historic narrative
as that which joins a present tense with ‘ iam‚' ⁶ diu,' and such words, or with
πάλαι in Greek.

32. Verrem, the joke turning on the literal meaning of ⁸ Verres,'
‘a boar-pig,’ on which Cicero makes many coarse personal jokes in the
course of his speech.

4²- Facta manu armataque. ‘having collected a body of men and
armed them.'

57. In instrumento atque in supellectile, ‘among the equipage
and furniture.' The two words are here really synonymous.

60. Praesertim, ‘and that too!

83. Qae esset, ‘though it was;' a concessive relative clause.

87. Possetis. Zumpt has ⁴ possitis) Either reading is admissible.
, ⁸ Possetis' may be justified on the ground that the principal verb is an historic
present, ¹ possitis· on the ground that the purpose is now present though the
act of which it was the purpose is past.

11. How Verres carried ⁰ff the Image of Juno from Melita.

11. 11. ι. Satis lato. 1t is forty-seven geographical miles from the
nearest point of Sicily. Dict. of Geogr.

6. Illis, ⁴ in former days‚' in antithesis to ⁸ hac: ‘the present?

¹7· imprudentem, ⁶ unaware whence they came)

24. ludiciali iure, ⁸ regular jndicial process)

12. Verres compared to Pluto.

11. 12. ι. Constat ex. ‘rests upon!

9. Umbilicus. So on the same ground Delphi was called γῆς ὅμφαλω.
15. Aequam agri planities. Α sort estable-land,

16. Ab omni aditu circumcisa atque directa, ⁴ steep ων] prm-imum
