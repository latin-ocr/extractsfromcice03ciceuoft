enemies, the Mamertines of Messana, made a separate peace with them, and
an alliance, to which he adhered saithfnlly all his life.

8. Id quod ornamentum imperii est. He means that the possession
of provinces was one of the great distinctions of the Empire of Rome. A
'Provincia' was a country beyond the bounds of Italy, which had been
, conquered, and reduced to form a part of the dominion of Rome, under a
military governor. The word is probably derived from ‘providentia‚' and
means a territory entrusted to the care of some one. See Dict. of Ant, v. ‘ Pro-
vincia.’ Sicily, with the exception of Hiero's kingdom,was made a province
at the end of the first Punic War, and when in the second Punic War
Hiero's successor Hieronymus had abandoned the alliance with Rome and
joined the Carthaginians, his kingdom also, after the taking of Syracuse by
Marcellus, was added to the rest, and the whole island became a province,

16. Illud, ⁸ it,' i. e. Sicily. ⁰ Pateret' being a copulative verb, the pronoun

de Leg. Manil. 12, 34, where Cicero speaks of Sicily, Africa, Sardinia, as
⁸ tria frumentaria subsidia reipublicae.'

19. Monumentis, ‘memoriam’ Cp. Pt. 2. ch. 6. 15, where ‘monu-
mentum Marii’ means the temple built by Marius as a memorial of his
victories.

22. Marcellus. How far what is here said of Marcellus is true may be
gathered from note on 13. 6 of this Part, p. 306.

24. Superatis hostibus temperavit, ‘dealt gently with his enemies
when conquered:’ with this use os the dative aster ⁸ tempero( cp. in Verr. a.

construction are not numerous, and what there are sccm open to doubt!
