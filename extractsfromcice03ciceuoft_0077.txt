1. Cicero's Letter to his brother Qtz'ntus.

Q Cicero, brother of Marcus, was Praetor in 62 B.c. At the expiration
of his year of office, he, as was usual, was appointed to a Proviuce, and that
of Asia fell to his lot. The following extract from Merivale's Translation of
Abeken’s Life of Cicero (p. 80) will sufficiently explain the circumstances
under which this letter was written.

⁴ The passages in which Cicero mentions his brother Quintus at this period
deserve particular attention. He describes him as a man of sanguine and
irritable temperament‚ friendly and genial, easily offended, but as easily
pacified; tendet-hearted‚ and possessed of great kindness of disposition. But
, these qualities‚ though accompanied by an excellent understanding‚ were not
based upon strength of character or will; and we shall see in the sequel into
what errors such a disposition could lead him. That Qintus possessed con-
siderable talent is evident from the long letter his elder brother addressed to
him when he was Pro-praetor of the Province of Asia, whither he was sent in
61 13.c., the year after he had held, in conjunction with Caesar, the office of
Praetor. It is true he was free from the common vices of Roman governors.
corruption and avarice, but his fault was that he trusted others too easily.
and his administration was wanting in that vigorous and uncompromising
spirit of justice which is the first virtue of every man who fills an official
station, whether it be great or small. In many of Cicero’s letters to Atticus
we perceive how much he had it at heart‚ that his brother's conduct should
be above reproach. Nothing mean or dishonourable, he felt, ought to attach
to the name of Cicero, the name of one who aspired to be regarded as chief
of the Optimates. On this account he exerted all his influence to get his
brother's office prolonged a second year, hoping he might thus retrieve the
errors of the first. It was in fact prolongcd to a third year, against the wishes
of both; and thereupon the elder Cicero addressed the younger in the long
letter with which the present period closes; a letter which might rather be
called a treatise on the right government osa province. So rich in fact is it
in the noblest political principles and moral axioms, and in expressions of
