26. Id sieri nullo modo posse, ‘that it could not possibly be
allowed}

29. Etenim introduces an explanation how these ‘signa’ were ‘monu-
menta P. Africani,' ‘ meniorials of Africanus.’ ,

Ut—cognoscatis. This final clause states the purpose, not of what is
actually expressed in what follows, but of Cicero's relating it at that time.
The ellipse would hardly be bearable in English: we may insert some such
phrase as ‘ you must know that.’

38. Qum collocabantur. ‘ Qum' is here joined to an indicative
because the two events are simultaneous, not the one subsequent to the
other. Translate, ‘By the setting up in their town of those works of art
which had belonged to their ancestors.'

41. Ex oppidi nomine et fluminis. Both the town and the river in
which it stands were called Himera. There was also another river Himera
in the south of Sicily, on the banks of which Agathocles was defeated by the
Carthaginians, 311 ac. Cicero therefore means that both were personified
under the form osa female.

44. Sed. The force of the adversative particle here is the same as if the
sentence had run, ‘qui non modo fuit Himerae, sed et est et fuit Graecia‚' &a

50. Non quo=non eo quod, ‘ not on the ground that,' ‘not as though‚'
followed by a subj„ because the reason it gives is not the true one, and only
exists in idea.

54. Nunc, ‘ as it is.'

60. Beneficia, ⁸ the gifts.' Cp. note on Letter to Qintus‚ l. 133.

63. Adhuc, ‘ up to that time.'

68. Hospitium renuntiat. ⁴ formally declines to be any longer his
guest! Cp. the phrase ‘amicitiam renuntiare,' which expresses a formal
announcement that you cease to be friends with a person. It was the Roman
equivalent to ‘cutting' a person.

69. Atque adeo, ‘or rather.’

78. Quidquid vellent—probaturos, ‘that they should get a verdict
on any charge they liked, as soon as ever they brought it before him:

80. Educunt, ‘ summon,' a legal term.

Ab eo litteras publicas esse corruptas, ‘that he had tampered with
the accounts of the State!

82. Eius rei actio sit, ‘there was a regular form of procedure in such a
case? ’

85. P. Rupilius was the man who brought the war with the slaves in
Sicily to a successful end, 13.c. 132, and then, remaining there as proconsul,
regulated the government of the province, in conjunction with ten com·
missioners appointed by the State.

87. Agerent, ‘ should bring their a'ctions,’ a law phrase.

88. Edicto. The praetors on entering their office issued a statement of the
principles by which they intended to be guided in ‘the performance of their
judicial duties. For further information, see Dict. of Ant. sub voce.
