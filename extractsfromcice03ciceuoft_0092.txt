20. Ob salutem malle accipere. Supply¹pecuniarm⁹ ·had rather take
money to acquit.' Another reading is ‘ab soluto.’ ‘from the side which
wanted an acquittal,’ i. e. from the defendant.

27. Ei fuissent auctores redimendae salutis, ‘advised him to
purchase acquittal.’

²9· Perducit ad, ‘gets him to take‚’ ‘beats him down to! The HS.
here must surely stand sor sestertia, not sestertii. We cannot imagine Verres
accepting so small a sum as eighty sestertii, which only amounts to about
fifteen shillings.

35. Posset is a conditional conjunctive, a suppressed hypothetical clause
being implied.

37. Videret is oratio obliqua of an imperative, not of a present subj.
The direct form is not ‘ si sapias, videas‚’ ‘ if you were wise, you would con-
sidet-‚⁹ but ‘si sapis, vide: ⁸ if you are wise, consider what you have to do.’

39. Et iure iniquo et tempore adverso, ‘both in a position of
disadvantage and in adverse circumstances? If he had been a Roman citizen
he would have been ‘iure aequo ;’ as a ‘ Siculus‚’ a mere provincial, unable to
claim the privilege of a ‘civis Romanus,’ he was at a disadvantage, ‘iure
iniquo!

44. Consilio—conventu. A Roman province was divided for the
administration of justice into districts, in which courts were held at stated
times. ‘Conventus' sometimes means ‘the courts' or ‘assizes’ thus held,
sometimes the ‘ district' or ⁴ circuit‚' as here. ‘Consilium’ is the name
applied to the body of selected men belonging to the ⁴ conventus,' who acted
as jurymen or assessors. The phrase in the Acts of the Apostles xix. 38,
ἀγοραῖοι ἄγονται. ‘the courts were open,’ means that such a conventus
was then being held at Ephesus. See Dict. of Ant. art. ‘ Conventus:

46. Hoc rationis. ⁶ Rationis’ is genitive of quantity after h0c=tantum,
Translate ‘they had this much ground (for their confidence).’

56. M. Petilium. Verres' device in order to get rid of those who had
acquitted Sopater before was this. He appoints Petilius iudex in some civil
suit, ‘res privata,' which was then before him. Petilius pretends that he
cannot try the case without the aid of the same assessors as Verres had with
him in trying Sopater. Verres then says he can do without them, and dis-
charges them from their attendance on him. The rest of his ⁶ consilium’ then,
seeing what is aimed at, apply to be discharged on the ground that they
wished to support one or. other of the two litigants in the case which
Petilius was to try, So Verres is left to try Sopater's case with none but his
own creatures on the bench with him.

68. Si tibi—iudicem, ‘ if you don’t think me unfit to decide on
the case of a mere Sicilian Greek!

70. Die, ⁴ go on with your speech.’

71. Nam is here elliptical‚ giving the reason for the refusal to go on with
the case which is implied by his leaving his seat.
