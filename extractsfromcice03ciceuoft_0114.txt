288. Qium petebatur—deferebatur. As included in the account
which Cicero gives of his own words in the oratio obliqua, these verbs
would naturally have been in the subjunctive. If the reading is correct.
we must suppose that he does not give them as part of what he said
at the time, but inserts thern as 3 sort of parenthesis, to explain to his
present audience what occasion he was referring to when he used the phrase
*in conventu Siculorum.’ They then would be indicative, though past
tenses with ‘quum,' because the two clauses refer to simultaneous time, not
consecutive.

293. Commemoratione, either ‘my calling it to their mind,' i.e. ‘my
allusion to it.' or ‘what it called to their mind,’ i.e. ‘the recollections it
suggested.’ The former is perhaps the simpler.

296. Quantum—poterat. They would be trying to speak in Latin,
a foreign language, and one which as Greeks they would despise as
¹ barbarous!

299. palaestritis. Heraclius* inheritance was claimed by the ‘palae-
stritae,' or ⁸ guardians of the palaestra‚' on 3 false plea that he had neglected
to fulfil a clause in the will which required him to set up certain statues in
the palaestra. The inheritance which was thus transferred to the palaestritae
should by them have been held in trust for the people of Syracuse, but, as is
implied below, it was dIstributed among a few only, who were Verres'
supporters.

300. Inventorem olei. Aristaeus, mentioned above, l. 173.

307. Defuissent. Α sort of zeugma, as the word is used in 3 slightly
different sense with the two datives. ¹ Had refused to join in the general
wish of the deputies (that Cicero should undertake the prosecution of Verres),
and deserted the cause (saluti) of Sicily!

311. Proposui. Another zeugma. ⁸ Proposui' would not be the
natural verb to use with ⁸ meum animum in illos’ if it had stood alone.

313. Qam—dicebant. This is in the indicative, because the clause
is a sort of a parenthesis, explaining to his present hearers what ‘laudatio' he
meant. ‘Laudatio’ here means ‘a favourable testimony' voted by the
assembly. ¹ A vote of thanks ' would perhaps nearly express it.

316. *Aerario sanctiore. The ‘aerarium’ or state treasury at Rome
was divided into the ‘ aerarium commuue‚' where the ordinary revenue of the
State was deposited, and the ‘ aerarium sanctius-‚⁹ where the reserve fund was
kept, which was never touched except on great emergencies. Cp. Livy
27. 10 ‘Aurum vicesimarium (the produce of a tax of 5 per cent. on
the value of manumitted slaves), quod in sanctiore aerario ad ultimos casu
servabatur, promi placuit.’ See Dict. of Ant. under ‘Aerarium.' There may
have been something corresponding to this at Syracuse, or the phrase may
be used by analogy for ⁸ the safest place in the treasury.’

319. Perscripta‚ ⁴ a list written out in full.¹

32²· lta perscriptum erat. ‘ there was this entry made.'

325. Esse ignotum. Impersonal passive perfect of‘ ignosco.'
