being consecutive, or conjunctive, the clause being regarded as the apodosis
of a suppressed hypothetical clause.

30. Canephoroe. Gr. κανηφόροι, literally‚ ⁸ basket-bearers.' The
appliances for a sacrifice, such as the sacred 'cake‚ srankincense, garlands‚
sacrificial knife, &c, were carried by young maidens in baskets (κάνεον),
which they bore on their heads. In the greater festivals the office of
» κανηφόροι was one of high honour. As the attitude was a graceful one, it
was a favourite subject of Greek art. Illustrations may be seen in the
Dict. of Αηῐ.. and in Rich's Companion to the Latin Dictionary.

Qem 7 Cicero here pretends to forget his name, and to be reminded of
it by some one sitting by.

35. Aedilitatem. The aediles had the general charge of the public build-
ings, and among them of the temples. Along with these they had the duty
of superintending the festivals of the god5‚ aud the games (ludi) which were
performed in their honour. In the later period of the republic the aediles,
in order to make themselves popular, with a view to gaining afterwards
the higher offices, incurred enormous expenses in making these as splendid
as they could, and adding various attractions to them. Cicero here alludes

a. 26. 2, and the note on Letter to Quintus, l. 228.

45. Quatridui causa, i. e. sor the few days that some show or enter-
tainment which they gave to the people lasted.

52. Pro deum hominumque fidem, ‘heaven help us.' ‘good heavens.’
or some such phrase will sufficiently render this exclamation. ⁴ l’ro' is of
course the interjection, not the preposition. ‘Fidem' means here ‘lielp,’
‘protection.' 1t is governed by ‘ obsecro ’ understood.

55. Tot has here no correlative, and may be rendered generally · many,'
¹ numbers of!

63. superiorum, ‘his predecessors.'

74. Cuiusmodi—esse, ‘what you thought the courts at Rome were
like:

77. Quae fuerint. This would be subjunctive, even apart from its
being in oratio obliqua, for the relative here is consecutive, ‘ such as were:
limiting the ⁸ omnes res.'

81. Legatione, 'the office of a leggat115‚' who, as being only the deputy
