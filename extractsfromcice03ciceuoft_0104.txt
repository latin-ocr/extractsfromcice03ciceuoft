another version, it was founded by Egestus or Acestes, who was the son of a
Trojan mother and the river—god Crimisus. Virg. Ae. 5. 38

‘Troia Crimiso conceptum flumine mater
Quem genuit.'
The story of the Trojan origin of Segesta was convenient to the Romans

63. Evocabat, ‘summoned from home!

71. Tollendum locatur, ‘is ordered to be taken down.’ Literally‚
¹ the taking of it down is let by contract.’ ‘Locare' is the opposite word
