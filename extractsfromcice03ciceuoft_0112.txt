193. Sic habetote, ‘you are to understand.' ¹1 beg you to believe.’ In
some such way as this the future force of the imperative may be given.

200. Mensas Delphicas. ⁴ Mensa Delphica' was a name applied to an
‘abacus' or sideboard for displaying plate on. See Dict. of Ant. under
¹Abacus.’ The name probably originated from their being used in the
temple at Delphi to hold the offerings (ἀναθήματα.) which were presented
