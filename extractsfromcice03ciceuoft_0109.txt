11. 13. ROME'S RULE OF Hm PROVJNCES. 307

7. Adventum. See note on 2. 3. 13.

15. Karthaginiensium. This is quite contrary to what Livy says.
Cp. 25. 25, where he speaks of the Cartbaginian fleet under Bomilcar as
having its station in the harbour of Syracuse, and sailing out from thence to
attack the Roman fleet outside.

17. Myoparoni. This is a Greek word, μυοπάρων, apparently the
³ name of some kind of light, swift-sailing vessel, used by the pirates.

24. Urbem Syracusas. This description of Syracuse will be best
understood by referring to plans, such as may be found in the ordinary
Greek and Roman histories‚ or in Arnold’s Thucydides, vol. 3.

28. Prope—inclusos. He means this as a special feature of Syracuse,
because it was more common for ancient towns, especially Greek ones, to be
built at some distance from the sea, with a harbour detached from thern,
though sometimes joined by long walls, as at Athens.

29. In exitu, ‘at their outlet.⁷ He must refer to the narrow channel
between the Island of Ortygia and the main-land, which connected the two
harbours, and served as a sort of outlet from one into the other. He
evidently uses the word ‘exitu5,' as a sort of antithesis to ‘aditus,' the
mouth of the harbour.

31. Disiuncta‚ ‘separated from the rest.¹

39. In hac Insula extrema, ‘on the shore or edge of this island.
‘Extrema insula' is used like ⁴ summus mons) and such-like phrases.

44. Prytaneum‚ Gr. πρυτανεῖον. See Dict. of Ant. sub voce.

47. Continentur, ‘consist of.’ Cp. Cic. N.D. 2. 23 ‘Non enim Dii

. venis et nervis et ossibus continentur,' ‘are not made up off ὅτε.

52. Theatrum est maximum. ‘ Ofall the buildings described by Cicero
as existing in Neapolis, the only one still extant is the theatre, which he
justly extols for its large size. Diodorus also :illudes to it as the largest in
Sicily, a remark which is fully borne out by the existing remains. It is not
less than 440 feet in diameter, and appears to have had sixty rows of seats‚ so
that it could have accommodated no less than 24,000 persons! Smith's
Dict. of Geogr. vol. 2. p. 1065. ,

56. Non dubitasset auferre. It was afterwards transported to Rome
by Tiberius (Suet. Tib. 74). Dict. of Geogr. ubi snpra.

61. Ostenderetur is subjunctive, not merely as being in oratio obliqua,
but on its own account, as being in a causal sentence.

64. In ornatu. ‘In’ here is, literally, ‘in the case of! It may be
translated ‘in reference to,' ‘ in dealiug with.'

Habuit rationem, ‘ he took account of,' i. e. he attended to tlie
claims of.

72. Suburbano. Cpv note on 2. 1. 57.

73. Domum suam—suturam. Cicero means that if Marcellus abstnfmn
from taking any of these ‘ornamenta' for the decoration of liis own house.
the very absence of them would serve to reinind people that lie hid sludieil,
not his own sellish advantage, but the glory of lile state, and so suggest ‚t
