11.8, 9· Roma's RULE or· HEt< PROVINCES. 303

102. Quo scelere suscepto, ‘having committed this crime,' literally,
⁸ having incurred, taken upon himself, this guilt.'

107. Quod quum, ‘ but when;' ‘ quod' is here merely a conjunction. See
note below on ‘ quod tamen,’ 2. 13. 112.

9. How Verres treated Sopater at Tyndaris.

11. 9. 7. Apud eos—coleretur. The mood of ‘coleretur' makes it
part of what the deputies had said, and therefore we should have expected
‘se' rather than ‘eos.' Cicero uses the ‘eos' as if he were inserting the
clause in which it occurs as his own remark.

18. Proagoro. This appears to have been the title of the chief magis-
trate. ’

21. Ne multa, i.e. ‘dicam,' ‘to be brief,’ ‘not to make a long story
of it!

25. Attigisset is the oratio obliqua of ‘ attigerit.'

Quam mihi—senatum? ‘Don't talk to me of sacred character, or
penalties, or senate.¹

33. Conventu. See above, note on 2. 2. 44.

40. Videres, ‘you might see,' or rather in English, ‘you might have
seen,' i.e. ‘ifyou had been there.’ It is a conjunctive, being the apodossss
os the suppressed hypothetical sentence, not dependent on ⁴ quum,' for in an
inverted sentence like this, where the verb which follows ¹ quum ' is really the
, principal verb, it is always put in the indicative, except when, as here, the
principal verb would of itself be conjunctive. The real sentence is, ⁴ Hoc vix
plane imperato, illum videres.’ On these inverted sentences, which are very
common, especially at the beginning of a fresh stage in a narrative. see
Zumpt, 580. 12.

42. Caederet. Conjunctive of deliberation. The whole passage is, of
course, ironieal.

50. Deligari, ‘tied down.' 11 is the regular word for sastening a man
up t'or scourging.

5²· Aere. This may be either from ‘ aer,' in which case it means ⁶ in the
open air;’ or from ‘aem' in which case it means ⁸ on metal.' The former
seems the best.

61. D isposite, ⁶ arranging his offences under different heads!

65. Est. With each ⁴ est' supply ⁸ crhnenf

Est pecuniarum captarum, ‘it comes under the head os extortion‚' ihc
usual title sor which was ⁸ repetundae.'

66. Pecuniae magnae. This is a genitive of quality attached ιω
· signuin,' ⁰ a statne ot', i.e. worth, a large suin?

he represents it as an oll'cnce both against the allits. to uhorn the statne
belonged, and against the respublica who had restored ἱι tn thtin.
