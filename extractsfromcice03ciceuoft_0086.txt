396. Possunt—molestiae. By · lex censoria' are meant the conditions
on which the censors let the taxes to the publicani. Cicero is here
suggesting a kind of compromise between the strict justice which was due
to the provincials, and the interests of the publicani, whom he did not wish
his brother to offend. llis brother is to suggest to the provincials, that, in
making their bargains with the publicani, they had better not insist rigidly
on the terms which the censors had find, but consider the advantage of
getting the matter settled without dispute.

Ita—ut. The force of the particles is best expressed by turning ⁸ omnes'

&c., make mention of your goodness, &c., without making one exception
from the high praise they give you, namely, your hasty temper!

431. Deferunt ad nos, ‘bring-us word!
